### eda.ipynb

This notebook constructs and presents the dataset used throughout the project and includes an exploratory data analysis to better understand its characteristics. The analysis covers:

- **General Information and Statistics:** Using `info()` and `describe()` to examine the structure and summary statistics of the dataset.  
- **Risk vs. Reward Analysis:** Plotting *Volatility* against *Momentum*, scaled by market capitalization, to identify patterns in the 2022–2024 period.  
- **Correlation Analysis:** Checking relationships between features and assessing multicollinearity.  
- **Outlier Detection and Feature Distributions:** Identifying extreme values and distribution shapes to determine the preprocessing steps required for clustering.
